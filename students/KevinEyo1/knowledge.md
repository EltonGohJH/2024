### GitHub Actions

Learned how GitHub Actions fits into the development workflow, and how to use it to automate tasks. I used the GitHub Actions documentation to learn about the different types of workflows, how to create and configure workflows, and how to use the different actions available.

- **Resource**: [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- **Summary**: GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.

- **Resource**: [GitHub Actions Workflow Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
- **Summary**: GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax to define the events, jobs, and steps that make up your workflow. You can create a custom workflow or use a starter workflow template to get started.
