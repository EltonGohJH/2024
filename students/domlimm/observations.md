### Project: freeCodeCamp

<!-- Give an intro to the project here ... -->

freeCodeCamp is an open-source codebase and curriculum to learn and code for free.

PR Link: [https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/53233](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/53233)

My first PR in this project was improving the description and hint of a feature (i.e., Writing a function for the equivalent of `=FORMULA` in Excel) in a Spreadsheet Project.

### My Learning Record

<!-- Give tools/technologies you learned here. Include resources you used, and a brief summary of the resource. -->

Tools/Technologies learned:

- Gitpod

#### Gitpod

This was the first time I have come across Gitpod (and it was the topic for my Lightning Talk in Round A2).

As freeCodecamp's codebase is extremely large, there are many different configurations and areas to get the project up and running locally. Hence, first-time contributors were encouraged to use Gitpod to start the project.

### Observations from freeCodeCamp

- The set up was the most complicated that I have come across. There were many steps to do as it is a large project. However, the documentation is great such that it's comprehensive and concise in helping first time contributors to set up the project successfully. Alternatively to setting up locally, the team has integrated Gitpod into its project that really helped me as with limited time trying to speed up the contribution set up process.
- With a project that is this large scale, there is an active team available to manage and guide contributors i.e., Most issues and PRs are looked at rather quickly. However, overlapping with the previous point, the documentation speaks volumes and it helps saves developer productivity.

### Project: date-fns

<!-- Give an intro to the project here ... -->

date-fns is a modern JavaScript date utility library. It provides the most comprehensive, yet simple and consistent toolset for manipulating JavaScript dates in a browser & Node.js.

PR Link: [https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/pull/3687](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/pull/3687)

My first PR in this project was enhancing an existing function in the date-fns library. The action item was to create an alias for the more generic name that was initially given to the function.

### My Learning Record

<!-- Give tools/technologies you learned here. Include resources you used, and a brief summary of the resource. -->

Tools/Technologies learned:

- How an npm package actually works
  - This was my first time working on an npm package. I got to see and understand how a package is built and deployed onto the npm servers for use in other projects.

#### Observations from date-fns

- Compared to freeCodeCamp, it seems as though this project is managed by only 1 person. Responses on issues and PRs are rather slow (till this date, I am still waiting for a reply on my PR) which really is understandable.
- It lacks a contribution documentation too.

### Project: stdlib

<!-- Give an intro to the project here ... -->

stdlib is a standard library for JavaScript and Node.js. It has an emphasis on numerical and scientific computing applications. This library provides a conglomerate of libraries for mathematics, statistics, data processing, streams, etc.

### My Contributions

<!-- Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs -->

PR Link: [https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/pull/2008](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/pull/2008)

My PR in this project was to add more examples into the `math/iter/ops` (iter == iterator, ops == operations) namespace and to provide examples on the usage in this library.

### My Learning Record

<!-- Give tools/technologies you learned here. Include resources you used, and a brief summary of the resource. -->

Tools/Technologies learned:

- What's in a standard library for a programming language/framework
  - This was my first time working on such a project. I got to see and understand what is in a standard library.
- Considering the fact that it's a standard library, the GNU Make tool comes in really handy and running most of the project's features e.g., Tests, installing dependencies, etc.
- The reason why I picked this namespace to work on was because I came across generators in Python when I was reading in some of the more advanced concepts of the language. I thought this will be a good opportunity to apply what I have learnt and I was able to understand how similar this stdlib's namespace is.

#### Observations from stdlib

- Similar to date-fns, this project is managed by 3-5 active contributors.
- Even though there is a small team managing this project, the issues management and responses to comments in them are great! Issues all around are well labelled.
- This project's contribution docs is only in a single README file, considering its scale, this suffices. It's actually really well written too, providing well rounded help in starting!
