### My Contributions

<!-- Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs -->

My first [PR](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/53233) in this project was improving the description and hint of a feature (i.e., Writing a function for the equivalent of `=FORMULA` in Excel) in a Spreadsheet Project.

### My Learning Record

<!-- Give tools/technologies you learned here. Include resources you used, and a brief summary of the resource. -->

Tools/Technologies learned:

- Gitpod

#### Gitpod

This was the first time I have come across Gitpod (and it was the topic for my Lightning Talk in Round A2).

As freeCodecamp's codebase is extremely large, there are many different configurations and areas to get the project up and running locally. Hence, first-time contributors were encouraged to use Gitpod to start the project.

### Project: date-fns

<!-- Give an intro to the project here ... -->

date-fns is a modern JavaScript date utility library. It provides the most comprehensive, yet simple and consistent toolset for manipulating JavaScript dates in a browser & Node.js.

### My Contributions

<!-- Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs -->

My first [PR](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/pull/3687) in this project was enhancing an existing function in the date-fns library. The action item was to create an alias for the more generic name that was initially given to the function.

### My Learning Record

<!-- Give tools/technologies you learned here. Include resources you used, and a brief summary of the resource. -->

Tools/Technologies learned:

- How an npm package actually works
  - This was my first time working on an npm package. I got to see and understand how a package is built and deployed onto the npm servers for use in other projects.
