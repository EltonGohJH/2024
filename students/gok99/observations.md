### My Contributions

- Fixed an issue involving Pandoc's Texinfo Writer: [PR #9359](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/9359)

### My Learning Record

The Haskell tooling ecosystem (GHC, Cabal, Stack, Haskell LSP) makes writing Haskell quite enjoyable. In particular, Haskell's type inferencing and parametric polymorphism makes it easy to understand and modify code in a general and well-abstracted way. The language also allows for strong editor tooling that also helps make development a smooth experience.
