### Vue + Pug
#### Summary

Vue is a frontend JavaScript framework to build web user interfaces, while Pug is a preprocessor that speeds up writing HTML. In RepoSense, Vue brings the interactivity in the generated reports and Pug makes it easier to write more concise and readable HTML.

#### Aspects Learnt

Having some experience in frontend libraries/frameworks like React, I did not have too steep a learning curve when learning Vue; however, I still took some time to get used to concepts and the syntax of Vue including state management, the idea of single-file components, conditional rendering, reactive UI elements, and much more. One particular aspect I enjoyed learning and implementing in Vue was the ease of declaring state in a component just within the `data()` function. This was, to me, contrasted with React where `useState` and `useEffect` are more complicated and tricky to use.

### Cypress

Cypress is a testing framework that allows for end-to-end testing of web applications. I used it in RepoSense to write tests for the UI.

#### Aspects Learnt

Cypress was a new tool to me and I had to learn how to write tests using this tool as well as how to set up the test environment. Many Cypress commands are based on natural words like `.then`, `.get`, `.to.deep`, just to name a few, but the concepts of Cypress like asynchonicity, closures, and its inclusion of jQuery make it unfamiliar to me.
