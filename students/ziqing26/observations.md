It simplifies the development process and eliminate repetitive tasks by providing industry-standard solutions for crucial aspects of a project, including authentication, access control, routing, networking, state management, and i18n.


### My Contributions

PR 1: [docs(core): add DataProvider interface definition #5653](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/5653)

Initially I thought contributing to documentation is easy, but I realize that contributing to documentation requires good understanding of the codebase structure and the workflow.

[Refine Contributing Guide](https://refine.dev/docs/guides-concepts/contributing/)

The PR review process in Refine is surprisingly fast. My PR is reviewed within one week.

Observations of contributing process:

Issues that are labelled good-first-issues often have comments that ask to be assigned the tasks. But the maintainers tend to take long to reply them. At the time they got back to potential contributers, contributers might already not be interested in it.

Refine has a `Changeset` system where contributors need to label the impact on packages such as whether it requires a major version bump in any packages, as Refine uses a monorepo structure.

Refine is well-documented and its core team is quite active in issues, which is a hugh advantage for first time contributers because their questions got answered immediately. However, their good-first-issues still have high barriers to entry because of the complicated code structure. That being said, their maintainers make a good effort to explain what might need to be done to submit a PR in the issues, making it easier to understand.
