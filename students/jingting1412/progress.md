### Summary

I mostly worked on the frontend of Markbind, improving components and the UI of Markbind, as well as contribute to documentation. Some notable issues I've worked on are:

- [Changing seamless panels to inherit parent's colour](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/1697)
- [siteNav buttons shifting when scrollbar appears](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2217)
- [Upgrade TEAMMATES docs](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/12893)
- [Add new portfolio template](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/commit/147899a56e5731aa08b10277cf9d9047cecb2d90)
- Also attempting to achieve full search, but its a work in progress
