Merged [fix(curriculum): update instructions for step 110 for rpg project #53564](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/53564)  

Awaiting Review [fix(client): Add live image URL validation for portfolio images #53617](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/53617)  

#### Adding image URL validation for frontend

Learnt how we can use image() html object to verify if the image URL is live. 

#### Debugging CI/CD tests

Learnt that the previous test cases can affect the next test cases, so I should run all test cases in order to check if there's problems with loading and saving state.

Learnt to check if I forgot to check logic with loading saved states (adding a portfolio section in user settings, and loading that section portfolio)

### My Learning Record

Give tools/technologies you learned here. Include resources you used, and a brief summary of the resource.  

#### Setting up a GitHub repository with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Learnt to use VSCode to access code on the WSL. Git clone repository on the WSL, not on windows.

#### Discord server and forums

FreeCodeCamp has live Discord server and forums with active and dedicated contributors.  

Setting up was difficult, and while instructions could be clearer separated into Windows and Mac users (for Windows users, for Mac users), it was good they had detailed instructions. 

#### Wait time for help

As with all open source projects, getting help or code reviews can take time. I was fortunate my first PR was an easy fix and quickly reviewed within 15 mins, but my second PR is still awaiting review. Nonetheless, the contributors are helpful and helped point out the cause of my CI/CD issues.
