### Project: date-fns

date-fns is a modern TypeScript date utility library. It provides the most comprehensive, yet simple and consistent 
toolset for manipulating JavaScript dates in a browser & Node.js.

It is like Lodash for dates. It has 200+ functions to manipulate dates, is modular and immutable, uses 
native dates, provides I18n support, and is built using pure functions.

The project has a main library, [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns), and a documentation website, 
[date-fns.org](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns.org).
