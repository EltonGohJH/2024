### Project: Litestar
Litestar is a powerful, flexible yet opinionated ASGI framework, focused on building APIs, and offers high-performance data validation and parsing, dependency injection, first-class ORM integration, authorization primitives, and much more that's needed to get applications up and running.

### My Learning Record

1. Project outreach
Litestar's project outreach is one of the best that I've seen in any project. They are transparent about progress, and reach out to both users and contributers to encourage usage and contributions. Because Litestar is an ASGI framework that manages the majority of an application, it requires a large amount of effort and trust by users into the project. 

For example, they regularly post [updates on the Python subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/search/?q=litestar&) on major milestone and releases. Furthermore, they hold regular office hours live, and [recordings are also posted on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LitestarOrg). Furthermore, they maintain a very large pool of ["Good First Issues"](https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) for contributers to start on. As of writing, they have 20 such issues open.

2. Project management
Because Litestar is relatively new status compared to the very popular FastAPI, the maintainers have sought to prove the project's sustainability to their users. 

For example, in the past few years, one of the goals were to increase bus size, to a minimum of 5. They've since achieved this, and their project has been stronger than ever. This is in contrast to FastAPI, which infamously has only a [single maintainer](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/4263), who refuses to take on more maintainers or accept PRs.
