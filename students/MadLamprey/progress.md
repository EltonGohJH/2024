### Summary

In WATcher, I primarily identified critical UI issues, significantly enhancing interface and service functionalities to boost user experience and application efficiency. I also contributed to the documentation of WATcher to aid future development. In CATcher, my focus was on migrating the linter from TSLint to ESLint, a crucial step that enhanced code quality and facilitated better maintainability.
