### Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented and general-purpose programming language. It is used primary in the backend for RepoSense.

#### Aspects Learned

Some of the aspects I have learnt regarding Java:

* Using the IntelliJ Java Profiler to analyse code run time and memory usage to identify possible areas of optimisation
* Learning more about different code design patterns such as the Builder pattern
* Learning how to adapt design patterns for our own needs

#### Resources Used

* Java Source Code
  * The source code for Java was used to verify the time and memory usage of the code given by the code profiler, by cross-referencing bottlenecks identified in the code profile with the source code to identify inefficient code in the codebase
* Online Java resources such as [baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com/)
  * The resources provided alternative ways of achieving a certain results, which may help to increase the efficiency of the code
