### Pug
#### Summary
Pug, formerly known as Jade, is a templating language for Node.js and browsers. It simplifies HTML markup by using indentation-based syntax and offers features like variables, includes, mixins, and conditionals, making web development more efficient and readable.

#### Aspects Learnt
I learnt how to create a Pug template and integrate it into a Vue component.

#### Resources Used
StackOverflow, ChatGPT, existing codebase, [Pug Website](https://pugjs.org)


### Vue
#### Summary
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It offers a flexible and approachable structure for front-end development, with features like data binding, component-based architecture, and a simple yet powerful syntax.

#### Aspects Learnt
I learnt the rationale behind the [Single File Component](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html) structure, as well as how to implement it to refactor code. It was very similar to React in that the framework is structured around components, and props are still used for data flow.

### Cypress
#### Summary
Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework used primarily for testing web applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to automate testing workflows, including real-time testing, automatic waiting, and built-in support for modern JavaScript frameworks.

#### Aspects Learnt
I learnt how to write simple tests with the framework, as well as how to use the E2E live view to debug and design tests.
