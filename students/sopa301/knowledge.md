## Vue
#### Summary
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It offers a flexible and approachable structure for front-end development, with features like data binding, component-based architecture, and a simple yet powerful syntax.

#### Aspects Learnt
I learnt the rationale behind the [Single File Component](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html) structure, as well as how to implement it to refactor code. It was very similar to React in that the framework is structured around components, and props are still used for data flow. I also learnt how to access local files from within the framework to dynamically load data.
